# Restaurant Review

A Udacity Front-end Nanodegree project. Fix responsiveness and accessibility. Add service worker for offline navigation.

## Instalation

You can see what the page looks like [here](https://syknapse.github.io/restaurant_review_fend/) but you'll need to serve it to see the dynamic content.

+ Download this project to your local machine.
+ In your terminal check if you have Python installed by typing `python -V`. If you get a version number it is installed.
+ If you get an error message you'll need to install it from [Python's downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
+ If you are a windows user make sure you tick and accept the options related to `PATH`.
+ Once it's installed **close** your terminal and start it again. Check that python has installed correctly by repeating step 2.
+ Navigate to the project folder (example `cd documents\github\restaurant_review`)
+ Now launch the python server If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python -m http.server 8000`.
+ Now that the server is running go to your browser and open your local host on th eport you are serving (8000 in most cases): `http://localhost:8000`
+ You should now be able to see the running project.

## Spec

+ This website should provide a smooth experience on any screen size. It should be completely responsive taking advantage of wide screens and adapting to smaller mobile screens.
+ This website should be fully accessible and compliant with current accessibility guidlines. It should be easy to use and navigate using a screen reader and other assistive technologies.
+ This website should provide a service worker cache to show previously visited pages offline.
